Evaluating handwritten digit of  28x28 px image to correctly classify them ( 0 to 9 ).

Focusing on Neural Network concepts at the moment.
Started with one of the tutorial documents: https://www.kaggle.com/fchollet/simple-deep-mlp-with-keras/code/code

Current focus is on Convolutional Neural Network.
