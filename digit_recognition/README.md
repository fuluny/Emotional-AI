# Digit Recognizer

Learning Data Science with Kaggle: <br />
https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

Evaluating handwritten digit of  28x28 px image to classify them ( 0 to 9 ).

Current focus is on Convolutional Neural Network. <br />
Started with one of the tutorial documents: <br />

## Work in progress:
**cnn_model.py** = use of Convolutional Neural Network. <br />
**svm_pca.py** = use of Support Vector Machine and Principal Component Analysis (this is incomplete, but currently not being worked on. Run into memory problem or something, need to evaluate what's happening.)
