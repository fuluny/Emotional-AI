# Digit Recognizer

Learning Data Science with Kaggle: <br />
https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

Evaluating handwritten digit of  28x28 px image to classify them ( 0 to 9 ).

Current focus is on Convolutional Neural Network. <br />
Started with [Kaggle Tutorial: Simple deep MLP with Keras](https://www.kaggle.com/fchollet/simple-deep-mlp-with-keras/code/code) and [Neural Network API (Keras) Documentations](https://keras.io/)

## Files:
* **cnn_predict.py**: classifies 28x28 px image and writes the prediction into .csv file. Prediction made from saved model outputed by cnn_model.py </br>
### Work in progress:
* **cnn_model.py**: use of Convolutional Neural Network. <br />
* **svm_pca.py**: use of Support Vector Machine and Principal Component Analysis (this is incomplete, but currently not being worked on. Run into memory problem or something, need to evaluate what's happening.)
