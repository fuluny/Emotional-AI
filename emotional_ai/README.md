# Emotional-AI
Continuation of project from Global AI Hackathon (June 2017)

Used data from:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data
Consists of 7 categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).
Data consists of 48x48 pixels of gray scale image.

The initial purpose of this project was to learn about Neural Networks.

Further development will be made in the near future. Other methods of classification might be used. The goal is to create the most accurate model possible in the most efficient way.
