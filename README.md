# Learning Data Science

* Learning about Data Science with old and new kaggle competitions and other available datasets.
* Currently, focusing on classification problems using Neural Networks and other classifiers from Scikit-Learn.
* Eventually, other aspects of data science will also be included (maybe I'll use Wiki for placing my notes about data science and specific projects).

## Projects
* emotional_ai: classfication of human emotion from 48x48 px image.
* digit_recognition: classification of handwritten digit from 28x28 px image.
